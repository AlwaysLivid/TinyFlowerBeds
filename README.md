# tiny flower beds
Random Twitter bot I made out of boredom. This script generates a bed of flowers every X hours (2 by default) and tweets it out.

# Purpose
I just made this bot simply because I wanted to get the hang of the tweepy library. This bot was inspired by the @tiny_star_field bot on Twitter.

# Live Demo
A live demo of my script can be viewed here; https://twitter.com/tinyflowerbeds
