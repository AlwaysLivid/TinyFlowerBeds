# TinyFlowerBeds
"Tiny Flower Beds" is a bot that posts a tiny flower bed on Twitter every few hours.
It is licensed under the GPL license.

## Credentials

In order to use this bot, you'll need to have access to the Twitter API.

You can request access and get your credentials [here.](https://dev.twitter.com)

The bot will check for a file called `credentials.py`.

`credentials.py` should have the following format:


`CONSUMER_KEY = '<CONSUMER KEY>'`
`CONSUMER_SECRET = '<CONSUMER SECRET>'`
`ACCESS_KEY = '<ACCESS KEY>'`
`ACCESS_SECRET = '<ACCESS SECRET>'`


By default, this bot will prioritize environment variables over the `credentials.py` file.

If you believe that environment variables are more convenient for you, then you will need to register the following keys:
* CONSUMER_KEY
* CONSUMER_SECRET
* ACCESS_KEY
* ACCESS_SECRET
... and assign those keys to their respective values.
